# Multi-View Signal Viewer

Welcome to the Multi-View Signal Viewer project! This application allows you to visualize and manipulate multiple animated signals simultaneously. You can control the playback, zoom in and out, adjust speed, link graphs, and even save the signals as PDF reports. Additionally, you have the flexibility to transfer signals between different views.

## Features

### Adding an Animated Signal
You can easily add animated signals to the viewer. These signals can represent various types of data, such as audio waveforms, sensor readings, or any other time-dependent measurements.

### Manipulating Signals
The following signal manipulation features are available:

- **Pause and Play**: You can pause or play the animated signals individually or collectively, allowing you to control the playback as per your requirements.
- **Zoom In and Zoom Out**: You can zoom in or out on the signals to focus on specific sections or get a broader overview of the data.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the playback speed of the signals to observe the details at a slower pace or speed up to get a quick overview.

### Multiple Signals in Each View
The viewer supports adding multiple signals within each view. You can visualize multiple graphs simultaneously, making it easier to compare and analyze different signals.

### Independent or Linked Graphs
Each graph within a view can behave independently or be linked together. When linked, the graphs will update and synchronize their actions, such as playback, zoom, and speed control. This feature is particularly useful when you want to compare the behavior of multiple signals.

### Saving Signals as PDF Reports
You have the ability to save the signals and their details as PDF reports. This feature enables you to document your analysis and findings, including the visual representations of the signals, for future reference or sharing with others.

### Transferring Signals Between Views
The application allows you to transfer any signal between the different views effortlessly. This functionality provides flexibility in organizing and rearranging the signals according to your analysis needs.

## Getting Started

To use the Multi-View Signal Viewer project, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Start by installing the required dependencies and libraries as specified in the project's documentation.

2. **Launching the Application**: Run the application by executing the main script or following the launch instructions provided in the documentation.

3. **Adding Signals**: Use the interface to add animated signals to the viewer. You can specify the source of the signal data and adjust the display settings as needed.

4. **Manipulating Signals**: Explore the various controls available to manipulate the signals. Pause or play them, zoom in or out, adjust the speed, or link the graphs together for synchronized actions.

5. **Saving Signals as PDF Reports**: When you want to save a particular signal or a combination of signals as a PDF report, select the desired options from the interface and generate the report.

6. **Transferring Signals Between Views**: Move signals between different views by using the provided transfer functionality. This helps in organizing the signals according to your analysis requirements.
